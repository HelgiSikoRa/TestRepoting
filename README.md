Test Reporting (TestNG)
Lesson 03

1. Add maven-surefire plugin and reportng dependency to your pom.xml
2. Configure Log4j for reporting as in example(slide #5)
3. Create custom listener(implement ITestListener) and add meaningful messages(using Logger) to each of the implemented method
4. Create one more simple test(this test should be failed)
5. In your testng.xml create two sepatate tests(one should include successful test and another should contain new one from 5th step)
